# Welcome to TranscripTeam 

## Components Overview 
TranscripTeam aims to create a way for people who need to look through large amounts of digital media for specific information to collaboratively tag and transcribe that media for future use. 


----------


### User
A user can create a project or be added to a project. A suser signs up via email and creates a password. 

### Project
A user creates a project and names it. They then become the first member of the project and the leader, and can then add other users to the project. Other users may then contribute. 

### Media
The media involved can be anything- pictures, video, or audio. A media item is linked to the project- the link is placed to a youtube video for example. Each media element can then be "transcribed", a process that here means to actually transcribe what is being said in the media element, or to simply add "tags" to it- key words. Tags aare added to particular points in time on the media, demarking the start of a particular topic. This is the use case where the media being transcribed is lecture material and the video/audio is very long. The teammates provide markers at certain points of the video for other people in the future to search on and quickly find the parts of the video that discuss the topics they want to find.
